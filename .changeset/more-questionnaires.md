Agent conventions gain three questionnaires next to the React front end one: `backend-node` (API style and compatibility, input validation at the boundary, error handling, logging, database access, migrations and layering), `git-workflow` (worktrees and branches, commit messages, what the assistant may commit and push, pull request size, what is never committed, history rewriting, crediting the assistant) and `security` (secrets, adding dependencies, exact versions or ranges, untrusted input, destructive commands, network access, authentication and cryptography code). Each feeds only its own slots (`api.*`, `errors.*`, `logging.*`, `database.*`, `git.*`, `security.*`), so any of them can be combined in one configuration, and new conventions can now pick several questionnaires at once. `frontend-react` and the answers already saved are unchanged; the catalog is at 0.6.0.
