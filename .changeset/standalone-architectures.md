Architectures no longer have to live in a project. `POST /architectures` without a `projectId` (or with `null`) creates one outside any project instead of in a "Default project", and `PATCH /architectures/:id { projectId: null }` takes one out of its project. The app gains an Architectures page (`/architectures`, in the sidebar and ⌘K) listing every architecture with the project that holds it, if any, where a new one can be created with or without a project.
